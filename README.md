About
=====

Fly is a small side scrolling shoot them up, created as a recreational from my
main project, i didn't worked much on it lately, so i figured i should push it
somewhere, before losing it.

Game
====

The game feature a plane with two people on board, a pilot and a shooter,
grossely definied enemies, and mountains, when you can crash if you are not
careful.

Collisions are pixel perfect (or some approximation of it ;)) and there are
nice smoke/fire effects when they occure.

Customisation
=============

Cutter.sh allow to cut a level drawn in one image to several images, to place
in a dedicated level directory, and insert in game by modifiying the level.cfg
file, not much documented, but should be pretty obvious :P
